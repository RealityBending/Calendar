## Celebrations

![](calendar_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

In the Reality Bending Lab, we follow an astronomical calendar. The year
is divided in two main overlapping cycles, the **Rise/Fall** phases
(December - June) and the **Dark nights/Bright days** periods
(September - March).

*Note: this calendar is automatically updated daily thanks to an
automated R script that account for the exact dates of the solar and
lunar astronomical events (solstices, equinoxes, full moons) of the
current year.*
