## Celebrations

![](calendar_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

In the Reality Bending group, we follow the calendar of the
heosphorists. The year is divided in two main overlapping cycles, the
**Rise/Fall** phases (December - June) and the **Dark nights/Bright
days** periods (September - March).

*Note: this calendar is automatically updated daily, taking into account
the exact dates of the solar and lunar astronomical events (solstices,
equinoxes, full moons) of the current year.*
