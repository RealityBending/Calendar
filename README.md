# Reality Bending Lab’s Calendar


We are in **Winter**. The **Dark Nights** are upon us, and we are in the
time of the **Rise**. The next celebration is
[**Winenight**](https://github.com/RealityBending/Calendar#Winenight) in
**28** days.

## Celebrations

![](README_files/figure-commonmark/calendar_plot-1.png)

In the Reality Bending Lab, we follow an astronomical calendar. The year
is divided in two main overlapping cycles, the **Rise/Fall** phases
(December - June) and the **Dark nights/Bright days** periods
(September - March).

*Note: this calendar is automatically updated daily thanks to an
automated R script that accounts for the exact dates of the solar and
lunar astronomical events (solstices, equinoxes, full moons) of the
current year.*
